# Home Price Prediction Website

This project provides a step-by-step process of building a Home price prediction website. The aim is to create a model using scikit-learn and linear regression, using the Bangalore home prices dataset from Kaggle. The project also involves developing a Python Flask server to serve HTTP requests and a website built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for user interaction.

## Project Overview

The project follows the following steps:

1. Building a model using scikit-learn and linear regression with the Bangalore home prices dataset from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/amitabhajoy/bengaluru-house-price-data).
2. Writing a Python Flask server that uses the trained model to serve HTTP requests.
3. Creating a website using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript that allows users to enter home square footage, bedrooms, etc., and retrieves the predicted price by calling the Flask server.

The model building process covers various data science concepts such as data loading and cleaning, outlier detection and removal, feature engineering, dimensionality reduction, hyperparameter tuning using GridSearchCV, and k-fold cross-validation.

## Technology and Tools

The project uses the following technologies and tools:

1. Python
2. NumPy and Pandas for data cleaning
3. Matplotlib for data visualization
4. scikit-learn for model building
5. Jupyter Notebook, Visual Studio Code, and PyCharm as IDEs
6. Python Flask for the HTTP server
7. HTML/CSS/JavaScript for the user interface

## Output

The image below shows an example output of the prediction:
